This is a vim plugin for use with deltos; it's got syntax highlighting and some
keybindings for (at least):

- creating a new note `<leader>nd` (new deltos)
- yanking the current ID `<leader>id`
- viewing open notes by title `<leader>a`
- searching notes by tag `<leader>st` (search tag)
- following a link with `Enter` (links look like: `.(Title//<note id>)`)

Note that the overview screens use Unite.vim, so you should install that first.
NeoBundle or similar is strongly recommended.

I've never written a plugin before so I'm not entirely sure this works. Please
tell me if it doesn't.
